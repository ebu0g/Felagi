# Felagi

Felagi is a Flutter mobile application that helps patients quickly find pharmacies that have the medicines they need.

Many patients waste valuable time moving from one pharmacy to another, especially when searching for urgent or lifesaving medicines. Felagi solves this problem by allowing pharmacies to update their medicine stock and making that information instantly available to patients.

With Felagi, patients can search for a medicine and see which nearby pharmacies have it, along with important details such as location, phone number, price, and available quantity. This reduces delays in treatment, lowers stress, and can save lives.

Felagi also benefits pharmacies by increasing their visibility and simplifying medicine stock management. Overall, the app improves access to essential medicines and supports better healthcare delivery in communities where no centralized medicine availability system exists.
